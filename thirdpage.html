The common assumption is that the belief in Bakunawa is an indigenous legend, and has been a part of ancient astronomy and rituals in the Philippines since people first arrived to the region.  In reality, stories of Bakunawa are directly linked to the Hindu demi-god “Rahu”,  from India’s  Vedic period ( c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE) and was brought to SE Asia through trade and the expansion of the Indianized Kingdoms around 200BCE.  The stories travelled to areas of the Philippines through trade and subsequent migrations between 200-900CE.  Evidence of Rahu being brought to SE Asia also exists in Javanese Mythology, Thai Mythology, and other Hindu influenced areas such as China. </h4><br/>
