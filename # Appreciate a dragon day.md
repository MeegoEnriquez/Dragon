# Appreciate a dragon day

This repository is about the day we appreciate dragons. Dragon appreciation day lands every January 16. On this day we pay tribute to our dragons or at least will encourage  you to explore the cultural significance of the dragon in your society and history. My content focuses on Bakunawa our local (Philippines) dragon.



## Experience

In this experience, I was able to make my own basic 3 page website. With the help of our first exercise it was a
easier for me to build content. Learned how to micro manage things to code things easier.



## Problems

One of the problems I encountered was making an image size and place it in the way I wanted to, to solve it i googled for how to manipulate images with CSS. Another was how align the text, but thanks to Google I made it.



## Todos

If I had more time to do the project i would look for images to match as my header and body, take some time to learn about div and use containers for content. I would have also put in consideration minor details.
